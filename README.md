## About 

StonkKings is a platform to create and compete in stock trading competitions. Players enter trading competitions by paying an arbitrary fee. Players compete by making stock trades using a simulated stock portfolio. At the conclusion of a competition the player with the highest account balance is granted the fees collected from that particular competition. This lowers financial barriers to entry and also redefines meta strategies for generating returns trading. Competitions have arbitrary entry limits allowing for intimate competitons or competitions with a large player pools.
